# Stock-Taking-System
Stock taking system for a shoe selling company.

I developed this programme as a part of my HyperionDev bootcamp as a demonstration of my ability to use classes and object oriented programming. At this point in my bootcamp I had yet to learn about SQL databases so the data was written to and read from a .txt file. 

The programme allows the user to enter data about a shoe and the warehouse it is located in such as the country the warehouse is situated in, a unique identifying code for the shoe, the shoe's name, cost and the quantity stored. The user is able to view and edit stored data as well as search for a shoe via it's unique code.
